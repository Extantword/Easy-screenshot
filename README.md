# Easy-screenshot
Python script which allows to take screenshots without overcomplication. You won't have to spent precious intelectual energy deciding where to save a screenshot that you will only use one time in your life!.

# How to use it?

Run screen_cut.pyw. A console will appear, and it will be waiting for two clics from your mouse. These two clics will set the 'corners' of the rectangle that you wish to take an screenshot. And that's it, wait a few seconds and you will have a png with your screenshot!

# How to make this useful?

Now, here is where the fun begins. For this to be actually useful, you will have to do some twinkering in your part. The python script is intended to run with some fancy shortcut in you keyboard. This repository *does not* include this feature. You will have to sort it out for yourself. 

# Why the hell is there a batch file?

The repository includes a fancy batch file which will sort out things for you, but *only if you use windows*. This batch file will run the python script, open the folder where it is contained, and one second later, open an image of what you just captured.

# Why does the python script override the previous screenshot?

This is because, as stated in the description, this is only useful when you have to take an screenshot that you want sitting in your computer until the end of time. This, hopefully, can stop from you creating meaningless files with esoteric titles such as 'asdsadasdasd-png', '123alsdlasd.png', etc.

# How is this better than [insert native screenshot feature from OS]

It is not better, it is just for a different purpose: taking screenshots that you dont want sitting in your computer until the end of time. Taking an screenshot with, say, windows 10 native Win + Shift + S, asks you: where you want to save your file, how you want to name, search for the file, use it, and then dispose of it. With this script, you will only have to worry about where to give the clickity.
